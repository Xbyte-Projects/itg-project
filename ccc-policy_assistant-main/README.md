## Overview


This an experimental chatbot employing Artificial Intelligence tools to help users easily improve their understanding of policy topics related to California's community colleges. The bot's target audience are stakeholders who would like to participate in community college decision making and would benefit from curated and detailed information related to community colleges. Some examples might include board members, administrators, staff, students, community activists or legislators.

By making this tool available, we hope to demonstrate how policy advocacy can be supported through the use of technology. If you want to learn more or have thoughts about this application or similar tools or the underlying technology, please reach out.

Version 2 has been built using Google's new [Agent Development Kit](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/).

July 16, 2025


## Quick start

1. Ensure your environment has all the necessary files. We use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to create virtual environments. In this repo, the Conda configuration file can be found in `data\environment\environment_adk.yml`.
2. To see the bot in action run the following command line script: `streamlit run app.py` from the interface directory (`interface`).

## What's next

We'll add the code for 

1. Ingesting web data
2. Creating and deploying ADK agents
3. Deploying the Streamlit application to GCP
